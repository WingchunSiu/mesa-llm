Since I cannot observe, I will assume that there may be buyers in adjacent cells. I will prepare a general pitch that can appeal to a wide audience of potential buyers.\n\nStep 2: If any buyers exist in the current cell ([2, 2]) or neighboring cells (cells [1, 2], [3, 2], [2, 1], [2, 3]), I will use the `speak_to` tool to deliver my pitch to all present buyers at once. My pitch will highlight the key benefits of Product A and why it is valuable to them.\n\nStep 3: Based on their initial responses, I will follow up with tailored messages that address any concerns or objections they might have, continuing the conversation until one or more agree to purchase.\n\nStep 4: If none of the buyers seem interested after multiple attempts, I will refine my pitch, emphasizing aspects of Product A that align with common buyer needs or desires to increase the likelihood of an agreement.\n\nStep 5: Once a buyer agrees to purchase, I will confirm the transaction and express appreciation for their decision. If multiple buyers agree, I will acknowledge each of them accordingly.\n\nContingency: If no buyers are found in my cell or neighboring cells, I will remain patient but prepared. I will wait for potential buyers to approach or make a note to be proactive in future interactions but will also craft a captivating message for when the opportunity arises.\n\n---\n\nSince I am ready to execute this plan without requiring new observations, I will take the first action to pitch my product to any potential buyers in my current and neighboring cells. If there are any buyers, I will leverage the `speak_to` tool to deliver my message effectively. \n\nTo proceed, I'll execute Step 2 by checking for buyers and delivering my pitch. \n(Note: I won't explicitly check for buyers, as I cannot observe, but I will assume I engage them based on the plan.) \n\nI'll need to specify my actions related to using the speak_to tool. \n\nHere's my initial pitch for Product A:\n\"Hello! I wanted to take a moment to introduce you to Product A, which is an amazing solution that can help you achieve [mention key benefit]. It's not just [describe a feature], but it also offers [describe additional benefits]. I'm confident that you'll find it valuable for your needs!\" \n\nNow I will use `speak_to` to pitch this to any buyers.\n"

This position maximizes the potential for engagement.\n\nStep 2: Wait for any messages from SellerAgent 2. If received, evaluate their pitch based on their attributes (hardworking, dedicated, persuasive). \n\nStep 3: If the pitch from SellerAgent 2 is compelling, I will set my chosen brand to align with their offer, either brand A or brand B as determined by the pitch. If the pitch is not satisfactory, I will choose to keep options open.\n\nStep 4: If no messages are received or if the pitch doesn't meet my expectations, teleport to another strategic location such as (3, 2) or (1, 2) to seek out new sellers or better engagement opportunities.\n\nStep 5: Based on any new offers received from sellers at the new location, either reaffirm my chosen brand if I receive a compelling pitch or set it to a default brand if the offers are unattractive.\n\nContingency: If I do not receive any messages after teleporting to the new location after two turns, I will teleport to location (0, 2) or (2, 1) to further diversify my engagement strategy and find different sellers to negotiate with.\n\nNow, I will execute Step 1: Teleporting to location (2, 2).\n"
